The team was beaten by Croatia on penalties in a match Sunday morning, July 8, 2018.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin says he remains proud despite Russia's failure. \"(Putin) is watching, he is supporting the team We are losing a fair and great match They are still great people for us, they are heroes,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency after the match .\nRussia lost 3-4 on penalties after an extra-time stint was able to hold off Croatia 2-2. Peskov said, \"They are fighting in the field, we are proud of them.\"\nRussian fans also paid tribute to the team that bowed their heads down in defeat on penalties, ending Russia's dream at the 2018 World Cup.\nA roar of applause was heard in the stadium to appreciate the Russian fighting power that was initially underestimated at the start of the tournament. Russia started the tournament as the team in the lowest rank, but successfully reached the last eight.\nThe group of Russian supporters who came out of bars after watching the game remained eager to shout \"Russia\" on the streets, reported Reuters.\n\n![WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdR5h248eo3vteRUjMGCoDVRa7rBjyBLeWKf59DfRKF8o/WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif)\n\nYOU HAVE TO USE THE NEXT TEMPLATE TO MAKE YOUR POST.

The second encounter in the 2018 World Cup semi-final promises an open duel and the potential of many goals.\n\nBelgium became the most fertile team in this 2018 World Cup after making 14 goals from five games. That means, Eden Hazard et al averaged 2.8 goals per game.\n\nOn the other hand, France has ammunition that is not less convincing in the affairs of banging the opponent's defense. Driven by a 19-year-old teenager named Kylian Mbappe, Les Bleus was able to spread threats also through Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann. Olivier Giroud who became the spearhead has not been able to make a goal, but his ability to hold the ball managed to create space to be utilized the three names above.\n\n**French Meeting vs Belgium Records**\n\nThe history of meeting the two neighboring countries is fairly long. They have faced 73 times in official or friendly matches, with Belgium winning 30 times, France winning 24 times, and the remaining 19 draws.\n\nAlthough often met, in the World Cup two new countries two duel. France always came out winners: 3-1 at the 1938 World Cup and 4-2 at the 1986 World Cup.\n\nThe last meeting of France and Belgium occurred three years ago. Playing at the Stade de France in a friendly match, Belgium won with a thin score of 4-3.\n\n**Team Conditions**\n\nFrance will be able to return Blaise Matuidi in this match, after she missed the match with Uruguay because of the ban. That means Matuidi will be able to refill the left side of the field, replacing Corentin Tolisso which is played in the top 8.\n\nDidier Deschamps will have all his players for this match. Sempai this news revealed no French penggawa who suffered injuries. Deschamps predicted would not change the composition of players to face Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile in the stronghold of The Red Devils, coach Roberto Martinez will lose Thomas Munier is exposed to the accumulation of cards. There is a chance Yannick Carrasco will play, he will fill the left side and make Nacer Chadli will shift to the right side of the field.\n\nThe success of beating Brazil in the quarterfinal chapter shows the brilliance of Roberto Martinez's tactics. At that time he placed Romelu Lukaku on the right side, while Kevin de Bruyne was in the middle and operated as false 9. Martinez is quite likely to give another tactical surprise to muffle France.\n\n**Way to the Semifinals**\n\nFrance vs Belgium game held in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday (11/07/2018) at 01.00 am is predicted to run interesting because both teams play open and have a squad with superior individual ability. France is a bit more favored by some betting houses in Europe.\n\n\"It's going to be a super-exciting game with great players in both sides, it's going to be a men's game and we should be prepared to improve our level,\" Benjamin Pavard said.\n\nBeing one of the winning champions, France undergo a relatively lightweight action in the group phase. Their performance when it was considered less convincing, despite winning two wins and one draw.\n\nThe new Les Blues show the scary potential of his front line when he meets Argentina in the last 16. Relying on the speed of Kylian Mbappe, Les Blues won one of the fiercest fight in the 2018 World Cup with a score of 4-3.\n\nFacing Uruguay, France also look impressive. France managed to control the game to minimize the threat of Uruguay. Luis Suarez was made helpless, and France also benefited from Edinson Cavani's injury.\n\nExcept when faced with Japan, it feels no blemish in the Belgian appearance in this 2018 World Cup. Duel with the Blue Samurai actually shows the glory of Roberto Martinez anticipate a stressful situation. Martinez then made two substitutions, in which the two substitutes scored. From behind 0-2, Belgium finally won 3-2.\n\nMartinez once again proved successful in combining the individual skills of Belgian players and uniting them into a solid team when Brazil tamed. The change of tactics he made to Lukaku and De Bruyne could trick the Samba Team.\n\n**Estimate Starting Line Up**\n\nBelgium is very likely to come down with the same 4-3-3 formation as it beat Brazil. The only change is Munier who is absent.\n\nEven so in the French camp. With no player absent due to injury or accumulation, Les Bleus will be able to lower his best composition in the 4-2-3-1 scheme.\n\nBelgium (4-3-3): Courtois, Vertonghen, Kompany, Alderweireld, Carrasco, Witsel, Fellaini, Chadli, Hazard, De Bruyne, Lukaku\n\nFrance (4-2-3-1): Lloris, Pavard, Varane, Umtiti, Hernandez, Kante, Pogba, Mbappe, Greizmann, Matuidi, Giroud\n\n**PREDIKSI ENGLAND**\n\n![r397744_1296x729_16-9.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ67ehU8cHNCSSgfQj2yv1fgNuML4Woj5Pau2ksivDQ2z/r397744_1296x729_16-9.jpg)\n\nWill England lose the judgment in the 2018 World Cup semi-final round against Croatia, as they did against West Germany in the semifinals of 1990?\n\nIt is one that can happen. The reason, their opponent at the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow, on Thursday next dawn, July 12, Croatia, had two wins on penalties.\n\nAfter playing for 120 minutes twice, Serbia defeated Denmark in the last 16 and hosts Russia on penalties.\n\nBut, on the other hand, England also have a great chance to score the first World Cup finals for the first time since 1966. The reason, in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup, they have been dismantling their trauma for more than a decade on penalties.\n\nEngland beat with a score on match on penalties, namely 4-3, in the last 16 rounds in Russia which after playing 1-1 throughout 120 minutes.\n\nIt's a matter of moments. Also Harry Kane and his friends and Luka Modric cs are currently at his best moment to win. The probability bets can be very good and close to the 50-50 percentage.\n\nTherefore, what happens when in the field is very decisive. The history of flashbacks such as the penalty shoot-out and their past encounters could be as a sampling.\n\nThe reason, the British life of more than four times in previous meetings can be very different from now.\n\nCoach Gareth Southgate who rejuvenated the squad and the vision of the England team is now only two years of work on this Three Lions team. Similarly coach Zlatko Dalic on the Croatian team. He has only since 2017 after tackling Al-Ann club in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nSouthgate creates a new face of the England team with young players like Harry Kane, Dele Alli, John Stones, Jordan Pickford, Harry Maguire, and friends.\n\nWhile Dalic revitalized a very different Croatian squad in the World Cup, such as the team captain and inspirator, Luka Modric.\n\nThe key in open game in this semi-final match is out where Modric can ward off a British flagship weapon as the execution of dead balls.\n\nThe reason, of England's 11 goals in this 2018 World Cup, only three goals coming from the open game that is running.\n\n\"We saw how good they were from the ball-blow when it died,\" Luka Modric said. \"We have to improve how we defend.\"\n\nModric is a Real Madrid midfield player who knows the style of the Game of his colleagues in England. He had a long time playing at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nModric is a ball distributor, playmaker aka game manager, and good kicker. He points to former Dutch star Wesley Sneijder.\n\nEngland have no players like Modric or even like Ivan Rakitic, Mateo Kovacic, and Marcelo Brozovic. They can all become Croatian playmakers.\n\nBut the defensive midfielder from Liverpool, Jordan Henderson, who is \"mediocre\" can be very useful for Southgate to assemble his team's collectivity network to stem the attack of Modric cs.\n\nIn addition, direct-direct attacks from direct football styles will allow players to come off and score goals as did John Stones and Maguire. Likewise from a quick stroke on the wing that made Jesse Lingard and welcomed with a header Dele Alli in the Panama goal.\n\nEngland now have no players like Modric, Kevin De Bruyne, or Paul Pogba. But, the strength of their team-work is so powerful, so it's very easy to roll up Croatia. It will happen, if Modric cs not careful like Neymar cs from Brazil who jumawa compile face Belgium.\n\n**PLAYER PLAY ESTIMATION**\n\n**Inggris**: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Trippier, Henderson, Alli, Lingard, Young, Sterling, Kane\n\n**Kroasia**: Subasic, Vrsaljko, Lovren, Vida, Strinic, Rakitic, Modric, Rebic, Kramaric, Perisic, Mandzukic\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score |\n-|-|-|-|-\n- | France | vs | Belgium | - | 0-2 \n- | Croatia| vs | England | - | 1-2 \n\n##### Belgium and England definitely win and enter the final together I hope this year's English champion his world cup russia amin ...","author_reputation":"84212731360","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@masterwali/50-reasons-real-books-are-vastly-superior-to-ebooks","author":"masterwali","title":"50 Reasons Real Books are Vastly Superior to Ebooks","created":"2018-07-09T10:11:09.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T10:11:09.000Z","body":"![fhjshj.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVxdjxEqoYoHvUa8w3vbDjZCpHCQymLAzRmqfWZn7yYAG/fhjshj.jpg)\n\n1) Zombie Apocalypse Test: When the zombie apocalypse knocks out the electricity in town and the internet is down, your books will still work just fine. You might even be able to fight off a zombie or two by swinging a sizable Oxford Dictionary.\n\n2) Book Smell: No one raves about the ebook smell like they do about the “old book smell.”\n\n3) Focus: Ebooks are designed to distract you with links and “helps.” Books are designed for focus.\n\n4) Feel Your Progress: You can physically feel your progress through a book as the upcoming pages get fewer and fewer. Not so with ebooks.\n\nRelated Articles\nA Cynics Guide to EdTech, Pt. 4: E-ReadersThe 25 Best Online Master in Reading Degree ProgramsSavvy Student’s Study Skills: Reading\nSubscribe & Stay Informed\n\n![300.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc6q6x47ZC6SbRu2zd2LF4V6vL5kQJMdvkc4BJ1cHPdwN/300.jpg)\n\n\n5) Gravitas: The physical weight of the book imparts a sense of gravitas. In reading a book you are dealing with a real thing and not just digital wind, so it feels like something to take more seriously, respect more, and value greater than an ebook.\n\n6) Marginalia: You can write in the margins of books, but not with ebooks. Ebooks won’t let you write in different sizes at the same time, use cursive, or draw lines from one sentence to a note. Some of them won’t let you write anything at all. I like to write insults and complaints in my margins.\n\n7) Patience: Ebooks are designed for speed with skimming, scrolling, and linking. But physical books are designed for slow processing, with larger pages, no links, and concentrated singular lines of thought. The effect is slowness and patience instead of frenetic haste.\n\n![fxjj.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZJ1N16488RcekXCEM26H88EhExF81zcextNh5sSKmaQ7/fxjj.jpg)\n\n![logo.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPesixryZrui4GggvEGpzRS77tEb5SKWMzZvPN8pD29se/logo.png)","author_reputation":"403954428222","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@masril/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-semi-finals","author":"masril","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for Semi Finals.","created":"2018-07-09T10:31:57.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T10:31:57.000Z","body":"\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n1- | France | vs | Belgium | -2\n1- | Croatia| vs | England | -2\n\nSEMI FINALS STAGE - Submit your entry to keep competing for the 2,000 SBD prize pool:\n[Clickhttps://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/semi-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool].\n","author_reputation":"3669286096202","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/japanese/@crypto.hack/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-semi-finals","author":"crypto.hack","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Semi finals","created":"2018-07-09T11:08:00.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T11:08:00.000Z","body":"\n![football-3344911_960_720.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeRtJXVe8EZ8insMtNkRjMvfmkEeiKEPdM4R6WJ3Sg96j)\n\n@blocktradesさんがスポンサーとして、 @acidyoさんと\n@anomadsoulさんが企画してくださっている @blocktradesWorld Cup 準決勝に参加します。\n\nSteemitコミュニティが盛り上がる企画を提案していただいてありがたいですね。\n\n企画についての記事はこちらです→https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/semi-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool\n\n## 「ワールドカップ準決勝の予想」\n\nいよいよロシアワールドカップも準決勝です。どんな試合になるのか楽しみですね。\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2- | France | vs | Belgium | -2\n2- | Croatia | vs | England | -1\n\n\nワールドカップ準決勝の勝敗の予想は非常に難しいですが…ワールドクラスのプレイが見れるのは楽しみです。\n\nスポーツBARなどで観戦しても面白いかな〜と思っているので企んでいます。\n\n個人的にも、サッカーチームに体験に行くことが決まりました。今週の水曜日に参加してきます。\n\n怪我には気をつけて、ファンタスティックなプレーを心がけます（笑）\n\nLife goes on! @crypto.hack\n[Twitterはコチラ](https://twitter.com/cryptohack_)\n![5F11B056-D989-47A1-9934-6743CE7B0F23.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1521353869/ykdviq1cx5ndwp7upsyv.jpg)","author_reputation":"2748119661133","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradeworldcup/@cjofficial/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-semi-finals","author":"cjofficial","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Semi finals","created":"2018-07-09T12:04:39.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T12:04:39.000Z","body":"Well the world cup contest has been so interesting .

Ya se nos vienen la Semifinales del mundial Rusia 2018. Con grandes sorpresas, muy poco daban algo por estas selecciones que llegaron a la semifinal, al inicio del mundial. \n\nLa sorpresa de cuartos de final fue la caída de la pentacampeona del mundo Brasil antes una dura Belgica.\n\nAsi quedaron las Semifinales:\n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmX3wjPu6S8hE6x7A6FE1keUDgCckq9z8WXJrnSUVSVoZ3/image.png)</center>\n<center>[Fuente](https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2018/07/03/15306512812800.jpg)</center>\n\nVoy a dar un analisis de cada unos de los enfrentamientos. \n\n# <center>**Francias Vs Belgica**</center>\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRLU2k8bpxhXU1tMfYAFaXpuUSYW9YLaKsg1RZtBorcQV/image.png)</center>\n\nFrancia y Bélgica se enfrentan en la primera semifinal este martes 10/07, son dos selecciones con mas poderío ofensivo y los mas solido del torneo. Los franceses clasificaron a la semis tras vencer 2-0 a Uruguay gracias a su efectividad de cara al gol, se espera que Francia nuevamente mida los tiempos, arriesgue en ciertos momentos y que trate de ser efectivo pero sin perder el equilibrio.\n\nMientras el conjunto de Bélgica no llegaba a la semifinal desde 1986, es el conjunto mas goleador del torneo y esa es su mejor arma, llego a esta instancia tras vencer a Brasil 1-2, con muchas ocasiones de gol de Brasil, por suerte del conjunto de Bélgica lograron mantener la diferencia.  Sera un juego de varios goles por lo menos 2 a 3 goles-\n\n**Mi Pronostico**\nFrancia Avanza\nFrancia  3 - 1 Belgica\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT5F1USRKSe1U3qm2gtDUwy2L5nEcM8zQSnZB9UC4N1W8/imagen.png)\n\n# <center>**Croacia Vs Inglaterra**</center>\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQme8RoaF9qQqp7F7r5mG6CXdkQNfwMBrE84j62S2o3JaFa/image.png)</center>\nCroacia llegó a las semifinales tras vencer a Rusia en la tanda de penales al igual  tras vencer a Dinamarca, llega cansada tras disputar esas dos prorrogas, la clave sera el medio campo con un Modric impecable y ha sido unos de los jugadores  del torneo. Mientras que Inglaterra  llega con mas descanso su DT a rotado todos sus jugadores, llega con mejor pies que los Croatas. Inglaterra a pelara al balón parado que es su mejor potencia.  Sera un juego de poco goles. \n\n**Mi Pronostico**\nCroacia Avanza\nCroacia 1 - 0 Inglaterra\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT5F1USRKSe1U3qm2gtDUwy2L5nEcM8zQSnZB9UC4N1W8/imagen.png)\n\n \n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZdZ47nwjAoDinpQS2N4uVUaV1fkzKedSnPExkg7P8Fej/imagen.png)\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmah27egSYYKCYgZcQWzmCQEDCwvdXeMyrg8xsBE4KPzNo/image.png)</center>!","author_reputation":"129143689560","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@stevenmosoes/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-semi-finals","author":"stevenmosoes","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Semi finals","created":"2018-07-09T17:01:15.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T17:01:15.000Z","body":"<hr>\n<h3><center>This Year World Cup is more interesting with many surprises and the Semi - Finals is no different and am sure we are in for surprises.</center></h3>\n\nhttps://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTHfEBLYbmTaCbEvZXWoYEnrMATNTiQ8R7iastxe57a7r/football-3344911_960_720.png\n\nPlease note that this is a @blocktrades sponsored contest, supported by @acidyo & @anomadsoul.

Cavani's injury was definitely significant \nfor Uruguay's loss. The Uruguayan team desperately tried to find options to open the score but on each and every try there were at least 2 defensive players on every play... as Maradona stated: the French know what they are playing for and they dominate it perfectly.\n\nFrancia enfrentara a la selección de Bélgica, en un partido del cual seguramente veremos que saldrá el próximo campeón del mundo, sin embargo no podemos descartar a ninguna selección en este sorpresivo mundial donde las grandes selecciones de la historia ya han quedado fuera excepto los franceses.\n\n#### Español\nLa selección de Uruguay se despide de la copa del mundo después de perder su partido mas complicado de este mundial , un partido donde no se le dieron las cosas a los catrachos y en donde se vieron totalmente dominados por la selección francesa, pues a pesar de que dominaron durante muchos minutos del partido, en realidad no generaron verdadero peligro que amenazara la portería de Hugo Lloris.\n\n\nUna vez mas Mbappe fue factor decisivo para la definición del partido, pues aunque el jugador de 19 años no anoto gol en este encuentro, el peligro que crea en las porterías rivales es de verdad intimidante, es un jugador con un desequilibrio para los defensas rivales y que ya a su corta edad combina a la perfección juventud con experiencia y gracias a su presencia Antoine Griezman juega mas libre y puede desenvolverse mejor en la cancha\n\nEn las estadísticas fue un partido sumamente parejo pero la defensa francesa logro borrar a Luis Suarez que cayo en la desesperación y no sumo para una posible remontada de los Uruguayos, definitivamente peso muchísimo la ausencia de Edinson Cavani por la lesión de la cual se resintió en el gemelo izquierdo  y aunque el equipo Uruguayo intento desesperadamente, en todas las ocasiones había uno o mas defensas de la selección Francesa que como bien dijo Maradona saben perfectamente a que juegan.\n\nFrancia enfrentara a la selección de Bélgica, en un partido del cual seguramente veremos que saldrá el próximo campeón del mundo, sin embargo no podemos descartar a ninguna selección en este sorpresivo mundial donde las grandes selecciones de la historia ya han quedado fuera excepto los franceses.\n\n<center>https://infobae-thumbnails.s3.amazonaws.com/07-06-2018/t_1530895156329_name_Uruguay_Vs_Francia_1_Gol_Francia_Rusia_2018_SF_31_scaled.jpg</center><center>[Source](https://infobae-thumbnails.s3.amazonaws.com/07-06-2018/t_1530895156329_name_Uruguay_Vs_Francia_1_Gol_Francia_Rusia_2018_SF_31_scaled.jpg)</center>\n\n<center>https://images.clarin.com/2018/07/05/rJeQcfTMX_930x525__1.jpg</center><center>[Source](https://images.clarin.com/2018/07/05/rJeQcfTMX_930x525__1.jpg)</center>\n\n<center>https://img.elcomercio.pe/files/ec_article_multimedia_gallery/uploads/2018/07/06/5b3f957d1e027.jpeg</center><center>[Source](https://img.elcomercio.pe/files/ec_article_multimedia_gallery/uploads/2018/07/06/5b3f957d1e027.jpeg)</center>","author_reputation":"31141830353596","match":[],"error":"COUNTRY_NOT_FOUND_1"},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@youngboss/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-semi-finals","author":"youngboss","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Semi finals","created":"2018-07-09T21:25:54.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-09T21:25:54.000Z","body":"We are almost there,  2,000 sbd is getting closer \n\n![football-3344911_960_720.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHoMixkagzHUHfj5xXHVBhQZZuZDJnHyvn7Ak6Tf8eEo/football-3344911_960_720.png)\n\nTo know more about the contest click [here](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/semi-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool)\n\nThis is my predictions for the semi finals \n\n\nScore\tTeam\tvs\tTeam\tScore\nL 1\tFrance\tvs\tBelgium\tW  2\nL 1\tCroatia\tvs\tEngland\tW  2\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n**Time is money!

Both Dedryck Boyata and Thomas Vermaelen who are on the Belgian players list are central defenders.\nThe greatest possibility is Martinez attracts Axel Witzel or Nacer Chadli to fill the Meunier position. But both players have more attacking character than survive.\n\n<center>![l2.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYBZQuom5iXZBQxAC91PCTg7BzH7jjMi3BPmMCiHRDGwA/l2.jpg)</center>\n\nCoach Martinez should really pay attention to the performance of his back line. Because the Belgian backline is often difficult when faced with a lively player and has speed. The Japanese, Brazilian and Tunisian players who succeeded in breaking Thibaut Courtois's goalkeeper have such player character, just like Mbappe has.\nNot only against Mbappe, Belgium should really be wary of Antoine Griezmann's performance.

Both Dedryck Boyata and Thomas Vermaelen who are on the Belgian players list are central defenders.\nThe greatest possibility is Martinez attracts Axel Witzel or Nacer Chadli to fill the Meunier position. But both players have more attacking character than survive.\n\n\n<center>![timnas-belgia_20170904_091137.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVgR33VebFF3HPuYhxZtA7ty8vi1BG15xTbSqiLxF9Nup/timnas-belgia_20170904_091137.jpg)</center>\n\nCoach Martinez should really pay attention to the performance of his back line. Because the Belgian backline is often difficult when faced with a lively player and has speed. The Japanese, Brazilian and Tunisian players who succeeded in breaking Thibaut Courtois's goalkeeper have such player character, just like Mbappe has.\nNot only against Mbappe, Belgium should really be wary of Antoine Griezmann's performance.

We are already in the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. With great surprises, very little was given by these teams that reached the semifinals at the beginning of the World Cup.\n\nThe surprise quarter-final was the fall of the five-time world champion Brazil before a tough Belgium.\n\nSo were the Semifinals:\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmX3wjPu6S8hE6x7A6FE1keUDgCckq9z8WXJrnSUVSVoZ3/image.png)</center>\n<center>[Fuente](https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2018/07/03/15306512812800.jpg)</center>\n\nI will give an analysis of each of the clashes.\n\n# <center>**France Vs Belgium**</center>\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRLU2k8bpxhXU1tMfYAFaXpuUSYW9YLaKsg1RZtBorcQV/image.png)</center>\n\nFrance and Belgium meet in the first semifinal this Tuesday 10/07, they are two teams with more offensive power and the most solid of the tournament. The French classified the semis after defeating Uruguay 2-0 thanks to their effectiveness in front of goal, it is expected that France again measure the times, risk at certain times and try to be effective but without losing balance.\n\nWhile the whole of Belgium did not reach the semi-final since 1986, it is the most goalscorers of the tournament and that is their best weapon, I come to this instance after beating Brazil 1-2, with many chances of Brazil's goal, luckily Belgium set managed to keep the difference. It will be a game of several goals at least 2 to 3 goals-\n\n** My Forecast **\nFrance Advances\nFrance 3 - 1 Belgium\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT5F1USRKSe1U3qm2gtDUwy2L5nEcM8zQSnZB9UC4N1W8/imagen.png)\n\n# <center>**Croatia Vs England**</center>\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQme8RoaF9qQqp7F7r5mG6CXdkQNfwMBrE84j62S2o3JaFa/image.png)</center>\nCroatia reached the semifinals after beating Russia in the penalty shootout after defeating Denmark, comes tired after playing these two extensions, the key will be the midfield with an impeccable Modric and has been one of the players of the tournament.
