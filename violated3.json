The young player was already compared to Pele when he emerged as a factor X for France, having looked good and scored twice against Spain in the last 16. According to Deschamps, Mbappe needs to be given the opportunity to earn lots of balls if he wants to make an impact while playing at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium.\n\n<center>![p1.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbbyo9Z42wHFze35RT5R2uSURU8RG4GEnRjpU9ufcMsWG/p1.jpg)</center>\n\nThe speed and sharpness of Mbappe has been the subject of talks at the World Cup. One observer's spotlight is how Deschamps can maximize Mbappe's role in a French-style front-liner with an attacking style.\nDeschamps from the beginning understood the situation he was facing. \"I can not complain that I have a player who can take an offensive position,\" Deschamps said earlier this year. \"But I can make sure that they will be used in their best positions.\"\n\n<center>![p3.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcRN6fZFa2EHEmw1pNu45RTZQELSpsLtqcGrYPwbnPcnn/p3.jpg)</center>\n\nAlthough many experts insist Mbappe is best used in the role of a classic center forward, Deschamps will likely play on the right side of the strike on Friday, giving Olivier Giroud a place to join Antoine Griezmann as the attacking trio.\nFrance needed all the attacking talent they could muster, as it could damage Uruguay's defenses like \"jackhammer\" trying to open a new path.\n\n<center>![p4.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaNidktyn63S7Y3T2JGErUFP9pKEMwBhqdw4Wir9HCcVq/p4.jpg)</center>\n\nThe South American team have recorded matches without conceding in six of their previous seven matches with team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez as the original wall.\nUruguay's game plan is well known.

One observer's spotlight is how Deschamps can maximize Mbappe's role in a French-style front-liner with an attacking style.\nDeschamps from the beginning understood the situation he was facing. \"I can not complain that I have a player who can take an offensive position,\" Deschamps said earlier this year. \"But I can make sure that they will be used in their best positions.\"\n\n<center>![p3.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcRN6fZFa2EHEmw1pNu45RTZQELSpsLtqcGrYPwbnPcnn/p3.jpg)</center>\n\nAlthough many experts insist Mbappe is best used in the role of a classic center forward, Deschamps will likely play on the right side of the strike on Friday, giving Olivier Giroud a place to join Antoine Griezmann as the attacking trio.\nFrance needed all the attacking talent they could muster, as it could damage Uruguay's defenses like \"jackhammer\" trying to open a new path.\n\n<center>![p4.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaNidktyn63S7Y3T2JGErUFP9pKEMwBhqdw4Wir9HCcVq/p4.jpg)</center>\n\nThe South American team have recorded matches without conceding in six of their previous seven matches with team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez as the original wall.\nUruguay's game plan is well known. Make your defense as strong as possible for your opponent and when you get the ball, go straight to Edinson Cavani or Luis Suarez.\n\n<center></center>\n\nUnless, the plan can be very disturbed if Cavani does not recover from a calf injury and failed to appear on Friday.\nUruguay did the exercises earlier this week for a number of options, with Cristhian Stuani likely to play sideways and Cristian Rodriguez was asked to offer more support to Suarez, who tried to hide his weakness when Cavani missed a chance.\n\n<center>![p5.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZMroLXqajbZ8SnynHjrTTdWmkhjD3iUGNAgo9nZim7Yt/p5.jpg)</center>\n\n\"It does not depend on the one player shown by Uruguay that we are dependent on collective work in the field.\n\n<center>![football-3344911_960_720.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHoMixkagzHUHfj5xXHVBhQZZuZDJnHyvn7Ak6Tf8eEo/football-3344911_960_720.png)</center>\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n1 | Uruguay | vs | France | 2\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 1\n0| Sweden | vs | England | 1\n2 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 1\n\n<center>![12.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRS6CjAD9a4BLUavZs6wb7bce6qpFcJh2Fp7JScxzDxcv/12.png)</center>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a @blocktrades sponsored contest, if you like what he is doing, vote for @blocktrades as witness [here](https://steemit.com/~witnesses)\n\nThis is an @acidyo & @anomadsoul organized contest, if you like what we are doing, vote for @ocd-witness as witness [here](https://steemit.com/~witnesses)Harry Kane Menatap Sepatu Emas","reputation":"89152401309","match":[[1,2,"l"],[2,1,"w"],[0,1,"l"],[2,1,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@saifulanwar/the-blocktrades-world-cup-last-8-or-brazil-vs-belgium-kompany-talks-about-gold-and-neymar-generation","author":"saifulanwar","title":"The @Blocktrades World Cup -  last 8 | Brazil Vs Belgium: Kompany Talks About Gold and Neymar Generation","created":"2018-07-05T05:35:33.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-05T05:35:33.000Z","body":"<center>![710020_720.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPWJ6svUX1X14ihhG9myuT6mKzjoPytJ5DtyppyAPHbbo/710020_720.jpg)</center>\n\nBelgium defender Vincent Kompany said Wednesday that the 2018 World Cup quarter-final match against Brazil, in Kazan on Friday, was the decisive game for his team.

So far they have not been able to excel and were eliminated in the final round of World Cup 2014 and European Championships in France two years ago.\n\n<center>![11.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdwVw6ZYe4vcaTEfH9t3e4saSYdZ388xo3AwoGJw3hnyB/11.jpg)</center>\n\nKompany says they are mentally tougher, especially as members of the squad have won at club level across Europe. \"It used to be in Belgian culture, and I think people will agree with me, we will try even before a match like this, but all the players in our team, who play in clubs around the world, now believe 100 percent we can beat Brazil. \nIs that realistic enough? \"I do not know, Brazil is a great team but there is no day when I sit thinking 'what if we lose'?\" he says.\n\n<center>![716120_720.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWoZA5PxXiGTmRYr9vpfcEaxNSch79WNMnmbDvtR2Y3WJ/716120_720.jpg)</center>\n\nKompany asked about the action Neymar often overreact when violated opponents.

Tolisso can be considered a player of the same type as Matuidi. He is more defensive and has good fighting skills in the air.\n\n<center>![11.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdwVw6ZYe4vcaTEfH9t3e4saSYdZ388xo3AwoGJw3hnyB/11.jpg)</center>\n\nWhen France beat Argentina, Tolisso also replaced Matuidi in the second half.

For this problem, precisely Fekir is more suitable. Players Olympique Lyon has the ability to move in a very good narrow area. The vision of playing Fekir plus matured passes can also be a boon for France.\n\n<center>![7.3.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXJJrGqyxRRsEWay5iLtiB6Wv5fUV5pcNFK3nUHztPLJw/7.3.jpg)</center>\n\nDeschamps are confusions that make the French players do not know who will play in tonight's game.
