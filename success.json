Steemian Friends,\n<p></p>\n\nIt's coming towards the end of a great month of football! The World Cup in Russia is drawing to an end and so is **[@blocktrades sponsored contest on Steemit](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd)**. It looks like \"Football Isn't Coming Home\". Sadly, and still feeling the effects today, England won't be in the Final. They will have to settle it with Belgium for third place. This isn't their first meeting in this World Cup as they were placed in the same group (Group G) and in the group game Belgium nicked it 1-0. However, Gareth Southgate did change much of the squad for that game as they knew they were through to the knockout stages and secretly, we believe they wanted to be second in order to go on the \"easier\" side of the knockout draw. The more experienced Croatia team upset the odds and have the chance to win the World Cup for the very first time in their history! Though, it is a matter of getting passed a star stud France team. We'll be routing for the French and English in both games (due to our interest) and therefore our predicted results favour them:\n<p></p>\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 | France | vs | Croatia | 0\n1 | Belgium | vs | England | 2\n<p></p>\n\nFinally, we want to thank **@worldcup-russia**, **@blocktrades**, **@anomadsoul** & **@acidyo** for hosting, sponsoring and organising what has been a thrilling contest! Loads of results did not go our way, but that is the beauty of the beautiful game. Upsets are meant to happen. Yet, we hope to bow out of this contest with two correct scorelines, but we'll settle for two correct results. Until Qatar 2022, all the best!\n<p></p>\n\nAs always,\n<p></p>\n\nStay Classy Steemians!\n<p></p>\n\n*Thank you for taking the time to read our post.

We know who will battle for the title and the 3rd place.\n\nIn both cases, even though it does not appear like that at a first sight, we have a rematch situation. \n\nThe final between France and Croatia (Hrvatska) is a rematch of a semi-final game from 1998 which was won 2-1 by France who ended beating Brasil in a lopsided game to clinch the World Cup title.\n\nThe match for 3rd place is more obvious since it is the rematch of the last game of the group of England and Belgium wichi was won 1-0 by Belgium. \n\nEven though I lived in France for most of my life prior moving to Germany. My heart would wish that Croatia wins the title, their team proved to have the willpower to win the games and went through extra-times and penalties to qualify for the finals.\n\nFrance did not have real difficulties even if the last minute of the 8th finals game against Argentina were a bit thrilling. In the end France always found a way to win in the regulation and will probably be fresher than its opponent. Their advantage is that they have a group which applies the strategy of Didier Deschamps who won the title in ..... You got it 1998. He was in the group. A very excellent defensive player.\n\nExperience against Willpower is a good mix and I am going to think that this year is Croatia¬¥s year.\n\nFor 3rd place I would see a win for Belgium in the hope that Fellaini does not make any mistake. \n\nHere we are with my picks\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n1 | France | vs | Croatia | 1\n2 | Belgium | vs | England | 1\n\nFor further information to participate to the contest I kindly invite you to use following link:\n\nhttps://staging.busy.org/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd\n\nI wish you good luck in the contest.\n\nBest regards\nYours\n@joel0101","author_reputation":"259939292081","match":[[1,1,"t"],[2,1,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@hasbydiaz/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-finals","author":"hasbydiaz","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Finals","created":"2018-07-12T11:43:03.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-12T11:43:03.000Z","body":"Score | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 | France | vs | Croatia | 1\n2 | Belgium | vs | England | 1 \n\nThis is a @blocktrades sponsored contest: https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd","author_reputation":"631600731334","match":[[2,1,"w"],[2,1,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@sabine-reichert/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-finals","author":"sabine-reichert","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Finals","created":"2018-07-12T11:46:00.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-12T11:46:00.000Z","body":"https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/20/21/57/football-1406106_960_720.jpg\n\n\n## My selection for the FINALS:\n---\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 | France | vs | Croatia | 1\n2 | Belgium | vs | England | 2\n\n---\n\n\n#### For the original Post see here: https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd\n\n### Thanks to @blocktrades, @anomadsoul and @acidyo.\n\n## Good Lock and much Fun to all!\n\n---\n\n*Image Credit: Pixabay CC0 License*","author_reputation":"10824640967282","match":[[2,1,"w"],[2,2,"t"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@dernierdiaz/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-finals","author":"dernierdiaz","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Finals","created":"2018-07-12T11:51:00.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-12T11:51:00.000Z","body":"Score | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n3 | France | vs | Croatia | 1\n1 | Belgium | vs | England | 0\n\nThis is a @blocktrades sponsored contest: https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd\n\nThis is an @acidyo & @anomadsoul organized contest.","author_reputation":"53922000529","match":[[3,1,"w"],[1,0,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@lidsay/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-finals-75552f2b0033e","author":"lidsay","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Finals","created":"2018-07-12T11:51:06.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-12T11:51:06.000Z","body":"Hello Steemians! \nThese are my picks for the semi finals stage of the @blocktrades World Cup.\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/xqcvvgkdqo.jpg)[source](www.fifa.com)\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n0 | France | vs | Croatia | 1\n1 | Belgium | vs | England | 1\nThis is an @acidyo & @anomadsoul organized contest, sponsored by @blocktrades, so big thanks to all.\nIf you want to join the @blocktrades World Cup [Click Here](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/final-stage-submit-your-entry-and-win-2-000-sbd)","author_reputation":"178175234014","match":[[0,1,"l"],[1,1,"t"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@seesladen/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-finals","author":"seesladen","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Finals","created":"2018-07-12T11:52:42.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-12T11:52:42.000Z","body":"Phew!!!

There is no place of runner ups, let alone be third ones.\nAnd for the finals, no one can predict the outcome with 100% certainty. Croatia will be highly pumped up after securing a place in finals for the first time ever and they have nothing to lose . French, on the other side does have the advantage of speedy attack, solid defence and confidence (their 3rd world cup finals).

In just a few hours the world will know who will rank 3rd and 4th for this year‚Äôs football tournament.  \n\nSince both Belgium and England were defeated during their last games, they will now fight for the 3rd and 4th place respectively.\n\nThis will surely be a good duel between two highly tactical teams.  Both teams shows high level of energy and enthusiasm to win in their previous games, unfortunately both failed to hit their goal in favor of France and Croatia.\n\nSpeaking of France and Croatia, both of these team were lucky enough to enter the Final round now vying for the highest and second rank of the world‚Äôs famous sports tournament.\n\nThis will be the closest match in the world cup, both of the team have high solid defenses and both are composed of highly tactical players.\n\nSo while the world are waiting for the two last games of the world cup, here I am casting my personal score prediction as my entry to the contest hosted by @worldcup-russia.  Hoping I could get more scores to add with my current scores which I got from my previous predictions of the last rounds.
