The long awaited World Cup Russia 2018 started few weeks ago and the group stage as well as the Round of 16 are over. \nIt has been a great moment so far, hot, hilarious and sensational games from the team/nations.\nEven it was an unbelievable moment for the defending champ to be evicted from the race so soon. **Guess nobody saw that coming!**\n\nSome defeats are just too mysterious and unbelievable, but it is football. Anything can happen! \nAlthough, my nation was defeated but we had a better game so far in the history of World Cup. I'm looking forward to a better competition next four years, hopefully the squad would have gain much international experience.\n\n**Before the World Cup started, I was privileged to join a football prediction organized by @anomadsoul and @acidyo on the blockchain for a whooping sum of 2,000 STEEM BACK DOLLARS.

Notably, the 2010 World Cup champions were knocked out by the host nation, Russia. Belgium had to leave it to the last minute to win against Japan after going 2-0 down!

Yes, we didn't go for a draw which happened to three teams in the last round and they ended up going to penalties. We shall see what will happen!

Judging from my experience of watching football for so many years, I have to conclude that the 2018 world cup has been one of the most competitive and unpredictable series of its kind. \n\nAt this point in time, it has gotten to the point where each teams wouldn't just rely on quality alone, but would need luck along with hard-work. Dew to these factors, it's now so difficult predicting the outcomes of these matches.\n\nI was unable to get a correct score prediction for the round of 16 matches. Although I was able to get most of the final outcomes right, but at this point where a correct score fetches you a sounding 3 sure points, you wouldn't wanna get the outcome alone but you surely would long to see your predicted scores displayed after the final whistle of each match.\n\nThe next round will commence in two days time with Uruguay and France starting the show, while Brazil and Belgium will begin theirs later in the day. I'm participating in the quarter final round of the @blocktrade world cup, and below are my predictions for the four matches to be played.\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n1 | Uruguay | vs | France | 1\n1 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 2\n1 | Sweden | vs | England | 1\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 1\n\nIf you're interested in participating, then visit the below link for more

If you want to participate or know about the contest and its rules, here is the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool\"><strong> Link</strong></a>\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/04/23/17/08/football-3344911_960_720.png\n\n<p><center><a href=\"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/the-knockout-stage-is-on-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool\"><strong> Image source</strong></a></center></p>\n\n\n\nIn the last round I did well, I hope to continue on the same line to shorten the difference. France Vs Uruguay a clash of titans that I look forward to and which I will not be able to see due to work commitments, I hope the Uruguayans will pass, but for that they will have to annul the star of France, one Kylian Mbappe, who starts to build his history as the best player.\n\nIn this same key we will have the game of Brazil Vs Belgica, another match where the team that best played in the cup (in my humble opinion) against the card under the sleeve of South America. Brazil is our Madrid in the champions, meets and wins, when we neglect to raise the cup.\n\nOn Saturday we have less attractive clashes, but no less important, quarterfinals. A Russia Vs Croatia, the local faces against some Croats who go with everything, while in the other key is Sweden Vs England, some Swedes who want to be the rebellion of this cup, ranking above Italy, the Swedes want to prove that They came to make history and they did not come just for a walk.</p>\n</div>\n\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n1 | Uruguay | vs | France | 0\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 0\n1 | Sweden | vs | England |2\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 2","reputation":"26019624752799","match":[[1,0,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[1,2,"l"],[1,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@jmuda/world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals-6eca6ac1aa73a","author":"jmuda","title":"World Cup | My selections for the Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-04T12:55:18.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-04T12:56:00.000Z","body":"These are my picks for the Quarter finals of the @blocktrades World Cup contest running by @anomadsoul & @acidyo.\n\n![football-3344911_960_720.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHoMixkagzHUHfj5xXHVBhQZZuZDJnHyvn7Ak6Tf8eEo/football-3344911_960_720.png)\n\nBy: @worldcup-russia - [\"Quarter finals stage - Submit your entry to keep competing for the 2,000 SBD prize pool\"](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool)\n***\n\n\n#### <center>My selections for the Quarter Final Stage</center>\n\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n0 | Uruguay | vs | France | 1\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 1\n1 | Sweden | vs | England | 2\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 1\n\n***\n\n**Thanks**\n\n\n**@jmuda**","reputation":"1443366809306","match":[[0,1,"l"],[2,1,"w"],[1,2,"l"],[1,1,"t"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@johannfrare/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals","author":"johannfrare","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-05T00:05:18.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-05T00:05:18.000Z","body":"**<center>The last 8 are here!!

I don't watch the FA cup or Premier League, and didn't watch most of the world cup knockout stage matches.  The only matches I really watched were the two that England played.  In fact I watched the England vs Panama match in a bar in Taiwan, a rarity as football isn't popular in Taiwan.  Boy, that was a great match, but then we were playing Panama who were 43 places below us on the FIFA ranking.  Nevertheless, a win is win , especially when you win 6-1.  That was definitely a much needed boost of confidence for us.\n其實我並不是足球迷，之前分組賽也只是看了英格蘭的兩場賽事。 其中一場對巴拿馬，我到台灣的酒吧看。足球在台灣不太流行，能夠像英國到酒吧看球賽十分開心，而且還大勝6比1，實在為英格蘭國家隊打了一支強心針。\n<center><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10896 size-medium\" src=\"http://livinguktaiwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180704_193557-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Watching football in a bar\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" /></center><br/>\n\nTwo nights ago I watched Belgium vs Japan, not that I had planned to, but Japan were playing really well, and before I knew it I had sat through the entire game.   By the time I went to bed it was 4am.  The next morning I woke up at 11am, missing my normal yoga lesson.  See how the World Cup messes up my life!!!\n兩晚前原本沒打算看比利時對日本。但日本隊表現出色結果不知不覺看完整場賽事。上床時已是凌晨4點，第二天早11點才起床，還錯過了瑜伽課。你看世界盃多麻煩噢！\n\nEngland was due to play Colombia yesterday, kick off at 2am my time.   I had planned to watch that despite the previous late night.  What does sleeping a few hours less matter when you're supporting your home team.  By around 3.30am things were looking pretty much settled.  England was leading by a goal and there were just a few minutes of the game left. I was ready to go to bed.  A few minutes later, the worse thing happened, Colombia scored a last minute equalizer!  Oh no!  That would be at least another half an hour before I could go to bed.  Half an hour went by and still no sign of a goal.  It was looking more like a penalty shoot out which meant another 10 minutes or so.  On top of that, hubby tells me that we've never won on penalty shootouts before.  Shit.\n昨晚英格蘭對哥倫比亞凌晨2點開賽，這場一定要看。 3點半時英國仍領先一球，賽果似乎已成定局，我正準備上床睡覺。誰不知幾分鐘後，慘痛的情況出現! 我至少要再熬夜多半小時，結果原來半小時還不夠，還要多加10分鐘來個互射12碼/PK大戰分勝負。 更慘的是，老公說英格蘭在這方面從未贏過。\n\nWell, there's always a first for everything, and everything was worth it in the end.  As I went to bed at 5am, I noticed dawn was about to break outside.  This is such a beautiful world.\n世上所有事情都總有第一次。總算沒有白費我在熬夜。 到5點上床時，發覺窗外已晨光初現。 原來世界是這樣美。\n<center><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10892\" src=\"http://livinguktaiwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PSX_20180704_163555-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn in Taiwan\" width=\"736\" height=\"414\" /></center><br/>\n\nI'm not going to jinx things now, but there's always a first for everything.  If we can do it once, we can do it again.  Bring on the next game.\n能夠第一次打破魔咒，那必定可以再來一次。噢，都是不要說好，說出來可能不吉利。\n---\nThat aside, I will still make my predictions for the last quarter finals for the Blocktrades Worldcup, [you can find the link here](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool).\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n0 | Uruguay | vs | France | 2\n1 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 1\n0 | Sweden | vs | England |1\n2 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 0\n\n<br /><center><hr/><em>Posted from my blog with <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/'>SteemPress</a> : http://livinguktaiwan.com/the-world-cup-is-killing-me-%e4%b8%96%e7%95%8c%e7%9b%83%e8%a6%81%e4%ba%86%e6%88%91%e7%9a%84%e5%91%bd/</em><hr/></center>\n\nCheck out my latest project @LadiesOfAsia where we share fun and cultural diversity across Asia Pacific.\n<center>https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZCFN4quq9X7my9kzMQfu9TSbS3nZzv4FtkMqcEifqdXH/LOAbannerpost.jpg</center>\n\n<center>https://steemitimages.com/DQmQU3FMrmFqxmkc3RAg5ry5PddZ7SV9eh8acu7nC1BmfxQ/ASteemitpersonal.gif</center>","reputation":"27467588766542","match":[[0,2,"l"],[1,1,"t"],[0,1,"l"],[2,0,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@loladelolz/blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-quarter-finals","author":"loladelolz","title":"@blocktrades World Cup | My Selections for Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-04T12:03:48.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-04T12:03:48.000Z","body":"Goodluck to everyone competing for the @blocktrades world cup.

In fact until very recently, like most Americans my age,  the only famous soccer player I could name was the great Pele.\n\nThis got me thinking about one of my absolute favorite movies that I used to watch as a kid: *Victory*.\n\nI used to rent that movie at least 3 times a year (on BETA) when I was a kid. I absolutely loved it!\n\nYesterday, I realized I was going to have to write another post including my soccer picks. Considering I seem to be allergic to posting anything under 600 words, I knew I had to add something to spice up my pick post. My mind immediately wandered to *Victory*. \n\nBecause I have fallen prey to the phenomenon of my memory believing something was better than it actually was, I decided to buy an instant download of *Victory* from Amazon. Then I *told* my 13 year old son we were going to watch one of my favorite movies from when I was his age. \n\nI sat him down and pressed \"play\".\n\nI have to admit I was nervous. On more than one occasion, my memory has failed me. Something I loved as a child turned out to be absolutely horrendous (for example *Battle Beyond the Stars*).  However, as soon as the movie began, I was filled with confidence that my son and I were about to enjoy the next two hours of our lives. \n\nBecause I fell in love with this movie when I was 12, I honestly cannot tell you if it is a good movie or not. What I can say is that I love it as much now as I  did 35 years ago (perhaps more).\n\nWhen I first watched *Victory* I had no idea who the director was... and I didn't care. Budding action star Sylvester Stallone played the lead and it was about POWs escaping from a German prison camp during WWII. That is really all I needed to know. Throw in some sports and I was over the moon. \n\n<br><center>\nhttps://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/main_wide/public/escape-to-victory_main.jpg?itok=eXCCXRJR\n</center><br>\n\nBut yesterday I discovered that the director was actually John freaking Huston! The same Oscar winning guy who directed *The Maltese Falcon* and *The African Queen*. What? I had remembered the movie as pure nonsense, not an actual high quality film. \n\nHere is what I remembered. \n\nBy 1981, I had already seen *The Longest Yard* and *The Great Escape* at least 20 times each. *Victory* was a combination of the two. For 13 year old me, that was pure heaven!\n\nBefore I go any further, let me just state that I 100% understand that the premise of the movie is completely ludicrous. A Nazi officer, played by...\n<br>\n### Max von Sydow!!!!\n<br>\ndiscovers that a member of England's World Cup soccer team is imprisoned in a POW camp he visits.  Sydow's character, who was a former player himself, decides to set up a game between the POWs and Germany. \n\nAt first glance, this is ridiculous. However, there were some historical cases of POWs playing against German soldiers.\n\nAfter the game is set, the movie becomes the delightful combination of *The Great Escape* and *The Longest Yard* I mentioned earlier. \n\nBecause I hate spoilers, I won't say anything else about the movie except for the fact that all of the players on both teams were actual  international soccer stars from the 1970s.  The biggest of these stars was the great Pele himself. Not only does he play an important role in the movie, he also choreographed all of the soccer scenes (and there are many) that included some of the soccer stars' signature trick moves. \n\n<br><center>\nhttps://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/victory-1981-001-pele-football-pitch-00m-jn0.jpg?itok=bkM6GLBu\n</center><br>\n\nWithout ruining anything, I can tel you that at several points, I paused the movie to discuss the topics of: honor, sacrifice, and courage with my son. In addition, there is a tear-jerker scene that reminds us that under Hitler's reign, people from Poland and Czechoslovakia were not considered worthy of being treated with the respect of a prisoner of war. This scene inspired me to discuss the fact that there are administrations today that do not feel that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. \n\nAlthough I still loved watching *Victory* yesterday, I realize that I am biased by childhood nostalgia. I would be curious to hear from someone who watched it for the first time as an adult. Is *Victory* a good movie?\n\n*Images* [1](https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RmIk3UgAL.jpg), [2](https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/main_wide/public/escape-to-victory_main.jpg?itok=eXCCXRJR), [3](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/victory-1981-001-pele-football-pitch-00m-jn0.jpg?itok=bkM6GLBu)\n","reputation":"332024068077043","match":[[2,0,"w"],[2,1,"w"],[0,3,"l"],[1,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@hasbydiaz/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals","author":"hasbydiaz","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Quarter Finals","created":"2018-07-06T00:10:27.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-06T00:10:27.000Z","body":"My predictions for this round\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n0 | Uruguay | vs | France | 2\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 1\n0 | Sweden | vs | England |1\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 2\n\nContest info https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool","reputation":"628235795404","match":[[0,2,"l"],[2,1,"w"],[0,1,"l"],[1,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@helmilanscape/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals","author":"helmilanscape","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-06T07:02:24.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-06T07:02:24.000Z","body":"Score | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 | Uruguay | vs | France | 1\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 1\n0 | Sweden | vs | England | 1\n0 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 2","reputation":"2299654437193","match":[[2,1,"w"],[2,1,"w"],[0,1,"l"],[0,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@helpyou/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals","author":"helpyou","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-06T08:59:57.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-06T08:59:57.000Z","body":"![pixabay.com/en/football-kick-off-beginning-center-3475163/ CC0 License](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdA523DWXtMsYeQ8w83rxGmjPWUcqxqFgWQU5CbvUwZ5p/worldcup.jpg)\n\n[Invite Post see here.](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool)\n\n## my Selections:\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n0 | Uruguay | vs | France | 1\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 0\n1 | Sweden | vs | England |1\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 0\n\nHava Fun!","reputation":"125227977743","match":[[0,1,"l"],[2,0,"w"],[1,1,"t"],[1,0,"w"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@hendersonp/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-quarter-finals","author":"hendersonp","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Quarter finals","created":"2018-07-06T04:09:15.000Z","last_update":"2018-07-06T04:09:15.000Z","body":"<div class=\"text-justify\">\n\nHello steemians I hope you are very well, the end of the World Cup is approaching and we are already in the quarterfinals, each team feels more pressure because only the best are left and any mistake is fatal and it can be taken out of the world, I will leave my predictions in this @blocktrades contest, If you want to see the call to this round you can go here [ Quarter finals stage -

With Germany not even making it past the group stages and Spain, Argentina, Portugal gone after the first knockout round. Not to mention countries like Italy, Holland and Chile who did not even qualify (nor did Ellas, the 2004 European champions). Some unlucky breaks for teams that played well, in the likes of Senegal and Serbia for not making it out of the group stage and Japan losing in the dying minutes to Belgium in the round of sixteen. There were also some great performances put in by low ranked teams flying under the radar like Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, and Iceland against more difficult opponents. \n___\n\n![5C09825B-9277-4A16-B131-39C337A67494.jpeg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVgLDRxAjMdMp1qu5wJqoRkNNsRUCJ9BBfvs22GY9sBCR/5C09825B-9277-4A16-B131-39C337A67494.jpeg)\n[source](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkyN5dwAVzP/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=dxcrj84379as)\n___\n\nHaving said all that and hoping for some more exciting football — the following are my picks for the Blocktrades world cup [quarter finals completion](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/quarter-finals-stage-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool) shyte:\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 | Uruguay | vs | France | 3\n2 | Brazil | vs | Belgium | 2\n1 | Sweden | vs | England |2\n1 | Russia | vs | Croatia | 2\n\nPs: VAR is growing on me.

But that is football, you will never knew what surprise is waiting for you. The team that I expect to win the Worldcup is Germany were eliminated in the Group Stage and after that, my guess was Argentina and Spain but they were also eliminated in the Round of 16 by France and Russia respectively. But luckily, I bet on France and Russia to win because I wanted to bet on the underdog for the Round of 16. Through the Round of 16 and the Group Stage, football shows that \"Being the underdog doesn't mean being a loser\". You can beat the best team in the world if you believe and work hard for it. This time, I analyzed every match in the Quarter Finals and hopefully, all of my predictions will come true, I hope England will win Sweden through penalty shootout.\n\nThis contest is sponsored by @blocktrades and organized by @acidyo & @anomadsoul.

Unexpected results have became an everyday occurrence. \n\nSo much so that you wonder if the bookies are crying or laughing.\n\nFootball is a sport where everything can happen, and it’s not surprising to see smaller teams exceeding expectations. For example, Sweden and Bulgaria in 1994, Croatia in 1998, Turkey in 2002… Etc.\n\nBut nothing at the scale we’re seeing right now. Which makes picking the results of the next round all the more difficult.\n\nYou’re stuck between adapting to this new momentum where the underdogs are constantly (and consistently) knocking out the favorites, or if the trend would reverse in the next round.\n\nBut the best thing is that it doesn’t matter.
